FetchRx: Bridging the Gap in Medication Delivery

FetchRx is a web application developed using Express.js, EJS, and CSS, aiming to address the challenges faced by senior citizens in accessing their medication. Inspired by our volunteering experiences at Sage Brook Retirement Center, we recognized the burden seniors face in obtaining their prescriptions from hospitals and pharmacies. To alleviate this burden, we created FetchRx, a platform that connects medical professionals with individuals in need of medication delivery services, bypassing insurance intermediaries.

Features
Connecting Medical Professionals and Customers: FetchRx facilitates the connection between medical professionals and customers who have submitted requests for medication delivery, either directly or through their guardians.

Job Selection: Medical professionals can browse available jobs based on factors such as pricing, distance, and delivery times, providing flexibility and convenience for both parties.

Secure Data Handling: We prioritize data security and have implemented secure measures to ensure the confidentiality of users' information and prevent accidental data breaches.

Challenges Faced
Developing FetchRx presented us with several challenges, including:

Retrieving Data from External Databases: Integrating external databases while maintaining data security was a significant challenge we encountered.

Configuring APIs: Adapting APIs to fit our specific niche required careful configuration and consumed a considerable amount of time.

Our Achievements
Despite the challenges, we are proud of the progress we have made with FetchRx. We believe that our application offers a practical solution for individuals in need of medication delivery services, while also providing income opportunities for medical professionals.

Lessons Learned
Through the development of FetchRx, we gained valuable insights and skills, including:

Source Control Management: Managing source control within a team environment was crucial for maintaining an efficient workflow and collaboration.

Skill Enhancement: Re-learning libraries like Node.js and honing our development skills as a team was both challenging and satisfying.

What's Next?
As we continue to refine and improve FetchRx, our future goals include:

Expansion: We aim to expand FetchRx to offer a broader range of job opportunities for medical professionals, tapping into the growing market demand for flexible healthcare services.

Enhancements: We will continue to enhance the functionality and user experience of FetchRx based on user feedback and emerging technologies.
